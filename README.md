# Intergenerational transfers of infant mortality in 19th century northern Sweden


## The report on infant mortality for the HLCS journal.

Note that data is missing.

## General

Install **R** and *RStudio* and run the Rmarkdown files. You need data,
which is *not* included here (ask me). *RStudio* will guide you in installing the
necessary add-on packages.

You can choose as output media from *html*, *pdf* and *word*.

## Download

For opening an html document, choose "Download ZIP",
unpack the zip file and open the html document in a web browser. 

Better still, install [git](https://git-scm.com) and *clone* the repository
and *contribute*. Contact me if you are serious about it.
